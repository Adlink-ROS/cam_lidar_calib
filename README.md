# cam_lidar_calib: A ROS package to determine External Calibration b/w a Camera and a 3D-LIDAR
![alt text](images/coloredPointCloud.png "Colored Point Cloud Generated by the result of External Calibration")
The package is used to calibrate a Velodyne VLP-32 LiDAR with a Basler Camera. The methods used are fairly basic and sould work for any kind of 3D LiDARs and cameras. This software is an implementation of the work presented in the paper titled [Extrinsic calibration of a 3d laser scanner and an omnidirectional camera](http://robots.engin.umich.edu/publications/gpandey-2010a.pdf).

## Setup
It is necessary to have the following installed:
* [ROS](https://www.ros.org/)
* [Ceres](http://ceres-solver.org/)
* Drivers for camera and LiDAR

ROS is used because it is easy to log data in a nearly synchronized way and visualize it under this framework. For Non-Linear optimization the popular Ceres library is used.
